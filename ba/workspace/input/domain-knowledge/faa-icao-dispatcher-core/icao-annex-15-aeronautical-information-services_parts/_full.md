                                                   Historical background

Standards and Recommended Practices for aeronautical information services were first adopted by the Council on
15 May 1953, pursuant to the provisions of Article 37 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago 1944), and
were designated as Annex 15 to the Convention.

     Annex 15 as now presented has undergone the following development. The first requirements were developed by the Air
Navigation Committee as a result of recommendations of Regional Air Navigation Meetings, and were published by
authority of the Council as Procedures for International Notices to Airmen (PANS-NOTAM, PICAO Doc 2713) in
January 1947. In 1949, the Special NOTAM Meeting reviewed and proposed amendments to these procedures which were
later issued as Procedures for Air Navigation Services (PANS-AIS, Doc 7106) and which became applicable on
1 August 1951. In 1952, the PANS-AIS was reviewed by the First Session of the Aeronautical Information Services Division
which recommended the adoption of Standards and Recommended Practices. Following consideration by all Contracting
States, these recommendations were reviewed by the Air Navigation Commission and the first set of Standards and
Recommended Practices was adopted by the Council on 15 May 1953 as Annex 15 to the Convention. This Annex became
applicable on 1 April 1954.

    Table A shows the origin of subsequent amendments together with a list of the principal subjects involved and the dates
on which the Annex and the amendments were adopted by the Council, when they became effective and when they became
applicable.


                                                        Applicability

The Standards and Recommended Practices in this document govern the application of the Procedures for Air Navigation
Services — Aeronautical Information Management (PANS-AIM, Doc 10066) and the Regional Supplementary
Procedures — Aeronautical Information Services, contained in Doc 7030, in which latter document will be found subsidiary
procedures of regional application.



                                               Action by Contracting States

Notification of differences. The attention of Contracting States is drawn to the obligation imposed by Article 38 of the
Convention by which Contracting States are required to notify the Organization of any differences between their national
regulations and practices and the International Standards contained in this Annex and any amendments thereto. Contracting
States are invited to extend such notification to any differences from the Recommended Practices contained in this Annex
and any amendments thereto, when the notification of such differences is important for the safety of air navigation. Further,
Contracting States are invited to keep the Organization currently informed of any differences which may subsequently occur,
or of the withdrawal of any differences previously notified. A specific request for notification of differences will be sent to
Contracting States immediately after the adoption of each amendment to this Annex.




ANNEX 15                                                     (vii)                                                     8/11/18
Annex 15 — Aeronautical Information Services                                                                         Foreword

                                                 Status of Annex components

An Annex is made up of the following component parts, not all of which, however, are necessarily found in every Annex;
they have the status indicated:

    1.— Material comprising the Annex proper:

          a)   Standards and Recommended Practices adopted by the Council under the provisions of the Convention. They
               are defined as follows:

               Standard: Any specification for physical characteristics, configuration, matériel, performance, personnel or
               procedure, the uniform application of which is recognized as necessary for the safety or regularity of
               international air navigation and to which Contracting States will conform in accordance with the Convention; in
               the event of impossibility of compliance, notification to the Council is compulsory under Article 38.

               Recommended Practice: Any specification for physical characteristics, configuration, matériel, performance,
               personnel or procedure, the uniform application of which is recognized as desirable in the interest of safety,
               regularity or efficiency of international air navigation, and to which Contracting States will endeavour to
               conform in accordance with the Convention.

          b) Appendices comprising material grouped separately for convenience but forming part of the Standards and
             Recommended Practices adopted by the Council.

          c)   Definitions of terms used in the Standards and Recommended Practices which are not self-explanatory in that
               they do not have accepted dictionary meanings. A definition does not have independent status but is an essential
               part of each Standard and Recommended Practice in which the term is used, since a change in the meaning of
               the term would affect the specification.

          d) Tables and Figures which add to or illustrate a Standard or Recommended Practice and which are referred to
             therein, form part of the associated Standard or Recommended Practice and have the same status.

   It is to be noted that some Standards in this Annex incorporate, by reference, other specifications having the status of
Recommended Practices. In such cases the text of the Recommended Practice becomes part of the Standard.

    2.— Material approved by the Council for publication in association with the Standards and Recommended Practices:

          a)   Forewords comprising historical and explanatory material based on the action of the Council and including an
               explanation of the obligations of States with regard to the application of the Standards and Recommended
               Practices ensuing from the Convention and the Resolution of Adoption.

          b) Introductions comprising explanatory material introduced at the beginning of parts, chapters or sections of the
             Annex to assist in the understanding of the application of the text.

          c)   Notes included in the text, where appropriate, to give factual information or references bearing on the Standards
               or Recommended Practices in question, but not constituting part of the Standards or Recommended Practices.

          d) Attachments comprising material supplementary to the Standards and Recommended Practices, or included as a
             guide to their application.




8/11/18                                                       (viii)
Foreword                                                                            Annex 15 — Aeronautical Information Services

                                                       Selection of language

This Annex has been adopted in six languages — English, Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish. Each Contracting
State is requested to select one of those texts for the purpose of national implementation and for other effects provided for in
the Convention, either through direct use or through translation into its own national language, and to notify the Organization
accordingly.



                                                        Editorial practices

The following practice has been adhered to in order to indicate at a glance the status of each statement: Standards have been
printed in light face roman; Recommended Practices have been printed in light face italics, the status being indicated by the
prefix Recommendation; Notes have been printed in light face italics, the status being indicated by the prefix Note.

    The following editorial practice has been followed in the writing of specifications: for Standards the operative verb
“shall” is used, and for Recommended Practices the operative verb “should” is used.

     The units of measurement used in this document are in accordance with the International System of Units (SI) as
specified in Annex 5 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Where Annex 5 permits the use of non-SI alternative
units these are shown in parentheses following the basic units. Where two sets of units are quoted it must not be assumed that
the pairs of values are equal and interchangeable. It may, however, be inferred that an equivalent level of safety is achieved
when either set of units is used exclusively.

     Any reference to a portion of this document, which is identified by a number and/or title, includes all subdivisions of that
portion.

     In order to maintain a comprehensive edition of this Annex, the latest amendments have been consolidated in a new
edition of the Annex. In so doing, provisions with particular applicability dates have been adjusted editorially, as appropriate.

                                   RECOMMENDED PRACTICES


                                         CHAPTER 1.               GENERAL


     Note 1.— The object of the aeronautical information service (AIS) is to ensure the flow of aeronautical data and
aeronautical information necessary for global air traffic management (ATM) system safety, regularity, economy and
efficiency in an environmentally sustainable manner. The role and importance of aeronautical data and aeronautical
information changed significantly with the implementation of area navigation (RNAV), performance-based navigation (PBN),
airborne computer-based navigation systems, performance-based communication (PBC), performance-based
surveillance (PBS), data link systems and satellite voice communications (SATVOICE). Corrupt, erroneous, late or missing
aeronautical data and aeronautical information can potentially affect the safety of air navigation.

   Note 2.— These Standards and Recommended Practices are to be used in conjunction with the Procedures for Air
Navigation Services — ICAO Abbreviations and Codes (PANS-ABC, Doc 8400).

          landing of an aircraft would be severely at risk with the potential for catastrophe;

    b) essential data: there is a low probability when using corrupted essential data that the continued safe flight and
       landing of an aircraft would be severely at risk with the potential for catastrophe; and

    c)    critical data: there is a high probability when using corrupted critical data that the continued safe flight and landing
          of an aircraft would be severely at risk with the potential for catastrophe.

                                    1.2 Common reference systems for air navigation


                                             1.2.1 Horizontal reference system

     1.2.1.1 The World Geodetic System — 1984 (WGS-84) shall be used as the horizontal (geodetic) reference system for
international air navigation. Consequently, published aeronautical geographical coordinates (indicating latitude and longitude)
shall be expressed in terms of the WGS-84 geodetic reference datum.

   Note.— Comprehensive guidance material concerning WGS-84 is contained in the World Geodetic System — 1984
(WGS-84) Manual (Doc 9674).

     1.2.1.2 Recommendation.— In precise geodetic applications and some air navigation applications, temporal changes
in the tectonic plate motion and tidal effects on the Earth’s crust should be modelled and estimated. To reflect the temporal
effect, an epoch should be included with any set of absolute station coordinates.

     Note 1.— The epoch of the WGS-84 (G873) reference frame is 1997.0 while the epoch of the latest updated WGS-84 (G1150)
reference frame, which includes a plate motion model, is 2001.0. (G indicates that the coordinates were obtained through Global
Positioning System (GPS) techniques, and the number following G indicates the GPS week when these coordinates were
implemented in the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s precise ephemeris estimation process.)

     Note 2.— The set of geodetic coordinates of globally distributed permanent GPS tracking stations for the most recent
realization of the WGS-84 reference frame (WGS-84 (G1150)) is provided in Doc 9674. For each permanent GPS tracking
station, the accuracy of an individually estimated position in WGS-84 (G1150) has been in the order of 1 cm (1).

     Note 3.— Another precise worldwide terrestrial coordinate system is the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)
Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS), and the realization of ITRS is the IERS Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). Guidance
material regarding the ITRS is provided in Appendix C of Doc 9674. The most current realization of WGS-84 (G1150) is
referenced to the ITRF 2000 epoch. WGS-84 (G1150) is consistent with ITRF 2000 and in practical realization the difference
between these two systems is in the one to two centimetre range worldwide, meaning WGS-84 (G1150) and ITRF 2000 are
essentially identical.


                                               1.2.2 Vertical reference system

    1.2.2.1   Mean sea level (MSL) datum shall be used as the vertical reference system for international air navigation.

     Note 1.— The geoid globally most closely approximates MSL. It is defined as the equipotential surface in the gravity
field of the Earth which coincides with the undisturbed MSL extended continuously through the continents.

     Note 2.— Gravity-related heights (elevations) are also referred to as orthometric heights while distances of points above
the ellipsoid are referred to as ellipsoidal heights.

     1.2.2.2 The Earth Gravitational Model — 1996 (EGM-96) shall be used as the global gravity model for international
air navigation.

    1.2.2.3 At those geographical positions where the accuracy of EGM-96 does not meet the accuracy requirements for
elevation and geoid undulation on the basis of EGM-96 data, regional, national or local geoid models containing high
resolution (short wavelength) gravity field data shall be developed and used. When a geoid model other than the EGM-96
model is used, a description of the model used, including the parameters required for height transformation between the
model and EGM-96, shall be provided in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP).

    Note.— Specifications concerning determination and reporting (accuracy of field work and data integrity) of elevation
and geoid undulation at specific positions at aerodromes/heliports are given in the PANS-AIM (Doc 10066), Appendix 1.

                                              1.2.3   Temporal reference system

     1.2.3.1 The Gregorian calendar and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) shall be used as the temporal reference system
for international air navigation.

    Note 1.— A value in the time domain is a temporal position measured relative to a temporal reference system.

    Note 2.— UTC is a time scale maintained by the Bureau International de l’Heure and the IERS and forms the basis of a
coordinated dissemination of standard frequencies and time signals.

   Note 3.— Guidance material relating to UTC is contained in Attachment D of Annex 5 — Units of Measurement to be
Used in Air and Ground Operations.

     Note 4.— ISO Standard 8601* specifies the use of the Gregorian calendar and 24-hour local or UTC for information
interchange while ISO Standard 19108* prescribes the Gregorian calendar and UTC as the primary temporal reference
system for use with geographic information.

     1.2.3.2 When a different temporal reference system is used for some applications, the feature catalogue, or the
metadata associated with an application schema or a data set, as appropriate, shall include either a description of that system
or a citation for a document that describes that temporal reference system.

    Note.— ISO Standard 19108*, Annex D, describes some aspects of calendars that may have to be considered in such a
description.



                                              1.3 Miscellaneous specifications

    1.3.1 Aeronautical information products intended for international distribution shall include English text for those parts
expressed in plain language.

    1.3.2 Place names shall be spelt in conformity with local usage, transliterated, when necessary, into the ISO-Basic
Latin alphabet.

    1.3.3 Recommendation.— Units of measurement used in the origination, processing and distribution of aeronautical
data and aeronautical information should be consistent with the decision taken by the State in respect of the use of the tables
contained in Annex 5.

    1.3.4 ICAO abbreviations shall be used in aeronautical information products whenever they are appropriate and their
use will facilitate distribution of aeronautical data and aeronautical information.

    b) runway marking work, when aircraft operations can safely be conducted on other available runways, or the
       equipment used can be removed when necessary;

    c)   temporary obstructions in the vicinity of aerodromes/heliports that do not affect the safe operation of aircraft;

    d) partial failure of aerodrome/heliport lighting facilities where such failure does not directly affect aircraft operations;

    e)   partial temporary failure of air-ground communications when suitable alternative frequencies are known to be
         available and are operative;

    f)   the lack of apron marshalling services and road traffic control;

    g) the unserviceability of location, destination or other instruction signs on the aerodrome movement area;

    h) parachuting when in uncontrolled airspace under VFR (see 6.3.2.3 m)), when controlled, at promulgated sites or
       within danger or prohibited areas;

    i)   training activities by ground units;

    j)   unavailability of back-up and secondary systems if these do not have an operational impact;

    k) limitations to airport facilities or general services with no operational impact;

    l)   national regulations not affecting general aviation;

    m) announcement or warnings about possible/potential limitations, without any operational impact;

    n) general reminders on already published information;

    o) availability of equipment for ground units without containing information on the operational impact for airspace and
       facility users;

    p) information about laser emissions without any operational impact and fireworks below minimum flying heights;

    q) closure of movement area parts in connection with planned work locally coordinated of duration of less than one
       hour;

    r)   closure or unavailability of, or changes in, operation of aerodrome(s)/heliport(s) outside the aerodrome(s)/heliport(s)
         operational hours; and

    s)   other non-operational information of a similar temporary nature.

     Note.— Information which relates to an aerodrome and its vicinity and does not affect its operational status may be
distributed locally during pre-flight or in-flight briefing or other local contact with flight crews.


                                                    6.3.3 Data set updates

    6.3.3.1 Data sets shall be amended or reissued at such regular intervals as may be necessary to keep them up to date.

     6.3.3.2 Permanent changes and temporary changes of long duration (three months or longer) made available as digital
data shall be issued in the form of a complete data set or a subset that includes only the differences from the previously issued
complete data set.

                                                                6-5                                                          8/11/18

    6.3.3.3 Recommendation.— When made available as a completely reissued data set, the differences from the
previously issued complete data set should be indicated.

   6.3.3.4 Recommendation.— When temporary changes of short duration are made available as digital data (digital
NOTAM), they should use the same aeronautical information model as the complete data set.

    6.3.3.5 Updates to AIP and digital data sets shall be synchronized.
